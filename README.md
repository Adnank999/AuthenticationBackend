Laravel Authentication Backend with Role Management
This project implements a Laravel backend with authentication and role management using the Spatie Laravel Permissions package.

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
To begin, clone the repository and install the composer dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
composer install
2. Spatie Role Management Setup
The project uses Spatie Laravel Permissions for role and permission management.

Spatie Files Installation
Install the Spatie package:

bash
Copy code
composer require spatie/laravel-permission
Publish the necessary files:

bash
Copy code
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider"
Clear cached configurations:

bash
Copy code
php artisan optimize:clear
# or
php artisan config:clear
Add the necessary trait to your User model:

php
Copy code
use Spatie\Permission\Traits\HasRoles;

class User extends Authenticatable {
    use HasRoles;
}
3. Database Configuration
Open the .env file and configure your database connection settings:

bash
Copy code
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
You can either import the provided SQL file or run the Laravel migrations:

Option 1: Import the SQL file

Use a MySQL visualizer (e.g., MySQL Workbench) to import the provided laravelproject.sql.
Ensure the database schema name matches the one in your .env file.
Option 2: Run Migrations

If you prefer to run the migrations manually, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
php artisan migrate
4. Seeding the Database
There are three seeders provided to populate the database with roles, permissions, and users: PermissionsTableSeeder, RoleTableSeeder, and UserTableSeeder.

Important: Before seeding the database, ensure that the default authentication guard is set to api by following these steps:

In config/auth.php, modify the default guard:

php
Copy code
'defaults' => [
    'guard' => env('AUTH_GUARD', 'api'),
    'passwords' => env('AUTH_PASSWORD_BROKER', 'users'),
],
Run the seeders:

bash
Copy code
php artisan db:seed
Once seeding is complete, revert the default guard back to web:

php
Copy code
'defaults' => [
    'guard' => env('AUTH_GUARD', 'web'),
    'passwords' => env('AUTH_PASSWORD_BROKER', 'users'),
],
5. Running the Application
To start the Laravel development server, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
php artisan serve
6. Frontend Integration
After setting up the backend, you can refer to the frontend part of the project. For testing purposes, use the login credentials generated by the UserTableSeeder. Check the seeders for default user email and password information.

Notes
Ensure that the api guard is used for roles and permissions when running the PermissionsTableSeeder and RoleTableSeeder.
After database seeding, switch the guard back to web to handle web-based authentication correctly.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with the database schema, double-check your .env configurations and verify that the correct schema name is provided.
If permission issues arise, ensure that the roles and permissions were correctly seeded using the api guard.
